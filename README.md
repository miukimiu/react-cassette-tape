# React Cassette Tape

## About
This is the project I showed during my talk **SVG Illustrations as React Components** at React Conf 2018:

I only tested the code on Google Chrome and the idea behind the project was to show things that we can achieve with SVG Illustrations and React.

You can find the same project done with Snap.svg / Jquery here:
